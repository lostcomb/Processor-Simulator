This is a basic RISC instruction set.

Arithmetic:

  ADD Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Add two signed integers.
  SUB Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Subtract two signed integers.
  MUL Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Multiply two signed integers.
  DIV Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Divide two signed integers.

Logic:

  AND Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Bit-wise AND two signed integers.
  OR  Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Bit-wise OR two signed integers.
  XOR Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Bit-wise XOR two signed integers.
  NOT Rd, Ri, Rj  -- Bit-wise NOT two signed integers.

Control FLow:

  JMP Ro          -- Unconditional jump to PC + Ro.
  BEQ Ro, Ri, Rj  -- Branch to PC + Ro if Ri == Rj.
  BGT Ro, Ri, Rj  -- Branch to PC + Ro if Ri > Rj.
  BEZ Ro, Ri      -- Branch to PC + Ro if Ri == 0.

Load/Store:

  LDC Rd, #C      -- Load constant C into Rd.
  LDM Rd, MEM[Ri] -- Load word at memory location Ri into Rd.
  STM MEM[Ri], Rj -- Store word in Rj to memory location Ri.

Misc:

  NOP             -- No operation.

Where:
  Rd     = Destination Register,
  Ri, Rj = Operand Registers,
  Ro     = Offset Register,
  C      = Constant,
  MEM    = Memory
